A simple **C++ Library Book Management System** that lets you add, delete, issue, and return books using **Linked Lists** and **Stacks**.  
It also supports **undo functionality** for transactions and maintains a **history of book operations**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **core data structures (ADT concepts)** and **object-oriented programming** in C++.
